# Backend test layout

> Scoped instructions. Claude Code loads this file when it reads or edits a file matching the `paths` above; every other agent is routed here by `AGENTS.md`. The text was moved verbatim from `CLAUDE.md` at `9bb84d9` (lines 236–261) and is maintained here. Frozen original: `docs/archive/engineering-record/core-instructions.md`. The repository-wide rules in `CLAUDE.md` still apply.

## Test layout

`Backend/tests/` is grouped by module: `auth/`, `security/`, `compliance/`,
`scans/`, `assets/`, `topology/`, `credentialed/`, `web/`, `reports/`, `repo/`,
`rbac/`.
[`Backend/tests/README.md`](Backend/tests/README.md) says what belongs where.

Two rules the layout depends on, both of which fail loudly if broken:

- **The group directories carry no `__init__.py`, and must not gain one.** As
  packages, `tests/auth` and `tests/scans` collide with Backend's own `auth` and
  `scans` packages — pytest names the module `auth.test_auth`, Python resolves
  `auth` to the application package, and every test in the group fails to import
  with `ModuleNotFoundError`. Without the markers pytest imports each file under
  its bare basename, so **test file basenames must stay unique across groups**.
  One test imports another (`test_compliance_iso27001` reads
  `test_compliance_rule_wiring`) and does so by bare name for the same reason.

- **Never spell a path as `os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__))`.** A
  module's depth below `tests/` is no longer a constant, and that expression now
  resolves to `tests/` rather than `Backend/` — which surfaces as a confusing
  "no such file" from a seed lookup, not as an import error. Import the anchors
  from `testpaths` (`BACKEND_ROOT`, `REPO_ROOT`, `SCRIPTS_DIR`, `CORE_DIR`,
  `MAIN_PY`); `conftest.py` puts `tests/` on `sys.path` so it resolves from any
  group.
